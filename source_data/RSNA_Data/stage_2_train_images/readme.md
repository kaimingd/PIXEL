The RSNA Pneumonia dataset is a publicly available dataset created for a competition hosted by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in collaboration with Kaggle. The primary goal of the challenge was to develop machine learning models capable of detecting pneumonia in chest X-rays. This dataset contains 26,684 training data and 3000 test data.
